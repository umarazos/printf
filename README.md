The task assigned is to implement the printf function in C. The function should handle different format specifiers and
output the corresponding result. The function should have the following prototype:
int _printf(const char *format, ...);
The format string can contain the following conversion specifiers:
%c: Prints a single character.
%s: Prints a string of characters.
%d: Prints integers.
%i: Prints integers.
%u: Prints unsigned integers.
%x: Prints hexadecimal (lowercase).
%X: Prints hexadecimal (uppercase).
%%: Prints a percent sign.
We are also required to write a few helper functions to achieve the desired output. In addition, we should follow some
specific guidelines and restrictions as mentioned in the project description. No usage of global variables and formated
Betty style.
